                    <!-- Content -->
                    <p><b>Amerigo Vespucci</b> (1454–1512) was an Italian merchant, explorer, and navigator from the Republic of Florence, from whose name the term "America" is derived. Between 1497 and 1504, Vespucci participated in at least two voyages of the Age of Discovery, first on behalf of Spain and then for Portugal.</p>

                    <p>Vespucci was the first person to demonstrate that Brazil and the West Indies did not represent Asia's eastern outskirts as initially conjectured from Columbus' voyages, but instead constituted an entirely separate landmass hitherto unknown to people of the Old World. Colloquially referred to as the "New World," this second supercontinent came to be termed "America", deriving its name from <i>Americus</i>, the Latin version of Vespucci's first name.</p>

                    <h2>Early Life</h2>
                    <p>Vespucci was born in Florence, Italy, to a prominent family. He was educated by his uncle, a Dominican friar, and eventually entered the service of the Medici bankers. In the early 1490s, the Medici dispatched him to Seville, Spain, to handle their business interests. It was here that he became involved in the provisioning of ships for voyages of exploration.</p>

                    <h2>Voyages</h2>
                    <p>Vespucci's role in the Age of Discovery is primarily defined by two confirmed voyages, though some historical accounts suggest he may have embarked on four.</p>

                    <h3>Voyage of 1499</h3>
                    <p>Sailing under the Spanish flag, Vespucci served as a navigator. The expedition explored the coast of what is now Guyana and the mouth of the Amazon River. During this voyage, Vespucci made significant improvements to navigational techniques, particularly in the calculation of longitude.</p>

                    <h3>Voyage of 1501</h3>
                    <p>On his second confirmed voyage, serving Portugal, Vespucci sailed further south along the eastern coast of South America. It was during this expedition that he realized the landmass extended much further south than previously thought and was distinct from Asia. He famously described these lands in letters to his patrons in Florence, coining the phrase <i>Mundus Novus</i> ("New World").</p>

                    <h2>The Naming of America</h2>
                    <p>The name "America" was first used in 1507. A German cartographer named <a href="Martin_Waldseemuller.html">Martin Waldseemüller</a>, working in Saint-Dié-des-Vosges, produced a world map titled <i>Universalis Cosmographia</i>. Influenced by Vespucci's letters describing the New World, Waldseemüller decided to name the southern continent after the explorer.</p>

                        <img src="../media/images/articles/Amerigo_Vespucci/universalis_cosmographia.jpg" alt="1507 Waldseemüller Map" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 4px; border: 1px solid var(--border-main);">
                        <div style="color: var(--text-muted); font-size: 0.85rem; margin-top: 0.5rem;">Detail of the 1507 Waldseemüller map showing the name "America".</div>
                    </div>

                    <p>In the map's accompanying text, Waldseemüller wrote: <i>"I see no reason why anyone should justly object to calling this part... America, after Amerigo [Vespucci], its discoverer, a man of great ability."</i></p>

                    <p>Initially, the name applied only to South America. However, in 1538, the geographer Gerardus Mercator used the name "America" on his world map to refer to the entire Western Hemisphere, including <a href="North_America.html">North America</a>.</p>

                    <h2>Legacy</h2>
                    <p>Vespucci became a pilot-major for the <a href="Spanish_People.html">Spanish</a> government in 1508, charged with training pilots and compiling a master map of recent discoveries. He held this position until his death in 1512.</p>
                    <p>While Columbus is credited with the initial European discovery of the Americas in 1492, Vespucci's contribution was the intellectual realization that these lands were a new continent. Today, the name "America" is used globally, designating the continents of North and South America, as well as the <a href="United_States.html">United States</a>.</p>
